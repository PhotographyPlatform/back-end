## Cooperation Plan

#### key strengths of each person on the team 

As we know, in camp, we learn the same tools and operate the same labs. I think the strengths are similar, but of course there is something special that varies from person to person. 

The key strengths for Ihab are that he loves working together and trying something new,
and, About Sham, here lies the experience because she has worked in software development before and Hamza always prefers to work on new things. Traditional things must always be used, but change is required
and about last member Mohammad He is the most active member of the team and always suggests new things


- **Ihab:**
    Loves working together with others.
    Enjoys trying something new.

- **Sham:**
    Has prior experience in software development.

## Conflict Plan
#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
to review the problem and study the situation well, then as a team we decide which part we want and what we don't
#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
that will be unacceptable, as a team we should work as one and each one should participate and do their work
#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
as a team, their should be exchanged trust between the members; the ones with more experience should be trusted more and the ones with the less skill level should be given opportunity to learn new things by participating in the work
#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
first they should know that as a team everyone should work and do their part, second they should realize that by not working and contributing they won't be able to take the opportunity to develop their selfs and their skills, lastly they will be asked and judged by the evaluation team
#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
if nothing works to solve it when trying to solve the conflict directly with the members and see no improvement. but it's good to let the members know that you may need to escalate if your attempts did not work so that they can have a chance to solve the conflict before things go to higher level
